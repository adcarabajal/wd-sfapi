# wd-sfapi

> SFAPI client for webdriver

## Getting Started
If you haven't used [SFAPI](http://code.google.com/p/sfapi/) before, be sure to check out the [Quick Start](code.google.com/p/sfapi/) guide, as it explains how to include the library on Flex compilation.

## Flex automation using webdriver

### Overview
As you know, when you compile a Flash/Flex application, it generates a swf file that would be embeded on a html page. 
If you have to chose an automation tool there will be always some issues when try to access elements, because there are no elements on DOM.
The Selenium-Flex API allows you to execute commands on Flex objects. 
This interaction is acomplished by a library that must be compiled on flex application.
